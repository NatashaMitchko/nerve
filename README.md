# SCAVENGERHUNT
Scavenger Hunt is a game where users can accept challenges and complete them for points by uploading a photo of themselves completing the challenge. Scavenger Hunt uses computer vision to determine if the uploaded image constitutes a successful attempt and, if so, calculates the score based on how close the image is to the goal.

I built this app as my final project during my time as a software engineering fellow at [Hackbright academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com/). The program is a 12-week full-time engineering bootcamp that focuses on web-development in python. The main components are a PostgreSQL database, a server built using Flask as a framework, and the views that utilize Jinja templating.

#### Hi, I'm Natasha

I graduated with a degree in chemistry from NYU and am a New York native. After graduating I worked at Google for two years as a technical specialist for Google's emerging local ad products. After realizing I was passionate about the technical side of that role I decided to up-skill my computer science knowledge and pursue a career in software engineering. I recently completed a fellowship program at Hackbright Academy in San Francisco where I learning the hard skills to become a backend/ full-stack developer. In my free time, I enjoy 3D modeling in Maya and Unity as well as reading about current trends in chemistry and physics.
