# SCAVENGERHUNT
Scavenger Hunt is a game where users can accept challenges and complete them for points by uploading a photo of themselves completing the challenge. Scavenger Hunt uses computer vision to determine if the uploaded image constitutes a successful attempt and, if so, calculates the score based on how close the image is to the goal.

I built this app as my final project during my time as a software engineering fellow at [Hackbright academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com/). The program is a 12-week full-time engineering bootcamp that focuses on web-development in python. The main components are a PostgreSQL database, a server built using Flask as a framework, and the views that utilize Jinja templating.
